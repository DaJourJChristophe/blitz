The HyperText Markup Language (HTML) parser is
designed to organize and combine syntax tokens
from lexical analysis into a Document Object Model
(DOM) Tree. The HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
parser has six parser states. Refer to the list
below:

  1. OpenTag
  2. TagName
  3. TagClose
  4. AttrName
  5. AttrValue
  6. ElmClose

Each of the parser states listed above will be
explained in more detail below.

Each parser state has two functions. The first is
to determine if the state is valid and the second
being to determine where to go next in the state
diagram.

OpenTag — Checks for a left caret symbol and then
          schedules the TagName state. If the state
          detects a forward slash it will schedule
          the ElmClose state.

TagName — Checks if the token kind is a word and
          then schedules the TagClose and the
          AttrName states.
